                    <h2>01. Radical Open-Mindedness</h2>
                    <p>To upgrade your life, you must first dismantle your current ego. Your results are a direct reflection of your beliefs. Radical open-mindedness is the strategic ability to delete outdated data the second superior information arrives.</p>
                    
                    <h2>02. The 5 Pillars of Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Most fail because they vibrate on someone else's "Why." Identify which of these archetypes anchors your biological drive:</p>
                    
                    <div class="face-grid">
                        <div class="face-item"><strong>Service</strong><span>The necessity to solve massive problems for others.</span></div>
                        <div class="face-item"><strong>Creation</strong><span>The divine urge to build things that didn't exist before you.</span></div>
                        <div class="face-item"><strong>Knowledge</strong><span>The obsession with mastery and uncovering hidden truths.</span></div>
                        <div class="face-item"><strong>Growth</strong><span>The fanatical pursuit of your own biological optimization.</span></div>
                        <div class="face-item"><strong>Legacy</strong><span>The construction of influence that outlives your name.</span></div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>03. Your Psychological Armor</h2>
                    <p>Understanding your "Why" is about survival. In the dark phases of growth, discipline will fail you, but your "Why" will sustain you. It is the fuel that makes the sacrifice feel like a privilege.</p>

                    <h2>04. The Precision Filter</h2>
                    <p>A Purpose Statement is your ultimate decision-making tool. It is a filter that automatically says "No" to 99% of the world's noise, protecting your finite time for the 1% that matters.</p>

                    <div class="directive-box">
